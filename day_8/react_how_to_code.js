// In react we have Javascript Extension (JSX).
// Extension of react that allows use to write code with the combination of HTML and Javascript syntax.
// The way react want us to do is that it don't want to seperate the code with different languages but with different components.

// If we want to write class in JSX we use the className.

// JSX also gives you the ability to embed JavaScript right inside HTML (the JSX) between curly braces this way:
// <h1>Hello there! 2 + 2 is {2 + 2}</h1>
// Output: Hello there! 2 + 2 is 4

// Two types of Components
// 1. Class-Based 
// 2. Function-Based Components

// How to write an expression.
