### About
This repository contains all my notes from my 1 month front-end coding bootcamp with OneCodeCamp. In this bootcamp I will be learning the MERN stack.

### How to use this repository
If you want to learn from my notes you can clone this repository using git bash.

### Clone the repository
- Open the directory you want this application to be cloned. 
- Open git bash.

Or you can view the .md files straight from GitHub. Just go to a folder for a specific day and view the .md file for that day.
