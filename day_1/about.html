        <h4>Paul Kenneth C. Felices | WSAP: IT Head & Back-end Web Developer</h4>
        <blockquote>
            "Mr. Ariston Catipay is a programmer with experience directing a group of people. To be able to manage jobs effectively and produce the greatest results as quickly as possible, he classifies tasks into those that require urgent action and those that can be done later, and then he distributes assignments based on the abilities of his teammates. He is also cautious with his comments while appraising someone's job."
        </blockquote>

When someone has a question about concerns, ideas, and so forth, he is extremely approachable. Furthermore, he is adept at multitasking and devotes his attention to a project with zeal. Ariston is indeed a competitive student, as I realized when collaborating with him on our projects."
